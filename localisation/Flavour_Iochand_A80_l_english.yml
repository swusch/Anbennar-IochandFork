 A80_arming_nimscodd_title:0 "Arming Nimscodd"
 A80_arming_nimscodd_desc:0 "ACT I Prologue: Portnamm has historically avoided the fate of our Gnomish brothers within the old heartlands of the Hierarchy, becoming a destination for many of the refugees coming across the Gnomish Pass. While historically the city of Portnamm has had little interest in restoring the old Hierarchy, Simmar Loopwrench (commonly refeered to as Mr Loopwrench), leader of the merchants of Portnoy has taken a different view, eyeing a business opportunity, they propose to sell the services of the Tadlouds to our Gnomish brothers in there bid to reconquer the Dragon Coast. By doing this, the merchants will essentially buy out the existing armed forces of Nimscodd, making them subservient to the wishes of the Guild. With the Gnomish nobility emboldened by the recent destruction of Reavers they have taken up this proposal, eager to rebuild and secure their future. It is time to pen a new epic for our people, one that will redefine the destiny of the Gnomish people."

 A80_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
 A80_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "ACT II Conflict: The nation of Nimscodd is armed to the teeth, with tadlouds colours being seen dotted around the nation and merchants dealing in wares and weapons with the local Hierarchy. However, the road to claiming these lands is fraught with danger and kobold traps, we must first gather intelligence by establishing a web of spies across the kobold dominion to provide a safer path for our troops on our inevitable reconquest of the dragoncost. Only then will we ensure the new chapter of the Gnomish people begins without great tragedy."

 A80_reclaim_the_coastline_title:0 "Reclaim the Coastline"
 A80_reclaim_the_coastline_desc:0 "ACT III Climax: Kobold bodies way laste in the fields of the ancient heartlands of our people and gnomish engineers work around the clock to dismantle the elaborate traps both within the villages and the countryside, meanwhile injured soldiers recount their stories to budding playwrights who eagerly record their tales, which will no doubt be immortalized in the Nimsnoms  through grand theatrical productions. However, we must ensure that this great play of ours does not turn from a comedy into tragedy, we must eliminate the kobold threat once and for all."

 A80_pushout_the_kobolds_title:0 "Pushout the Kobolds"
 A80_pushout_the_kobolds_desc:0 "ACT IV Resolution: It is done. The kobolds have been swept into the sea and their hoard has been plundered by the guilds & their mercenaries, it is now time to draw the curtains on this saga and send travelling productions across Cannor to tell this truly national epic of our people!"

 A80_mine_the_spine_title:0 "Mine the Spine"
 A80_mine_the_spine_desc:0 "The kingdom of Iochand has never been known for its metal production, instead our people have been more whimsical, focusing on expressing themselves through the performing arts rather than locking themselves away in the damp mines. However with the conquest of the Kobolds a new opportunity has arisen, instead of expelling all these kobolds we will instead give them the option to stay and work there caves and secure a cheap source of raw materials for our budding artificery industry"

 A80_gold_in_norbit_title:0 "Portnoy Mint"
 A80_gold_in_norbit_desc:0 "The province of Norbit once was the mint for the entire Gnomish Hierarchy, supplying the gold needed to fuel the currency and the vaults of Nimscodd. However, all was lost during the dragonwake and the mine was looted and buried in the fighting. With the increased trade of Iochand there is a desire within to go back to the gold standard, and usher in a new era of economic expansion. Reopening the mine however will take considerable time and resources from the state due to its current condition." 

 A80_the_feast_title:0 "The Feasts"
 A80_the_feast_desc:0 "A banner hangs outside the entrance of the city: “Join The Tadlouds Today and we’ll keep your coffers and your belly full”, Ollik recalled that while the merchants pay had been consistent, even during lengthy campaigns, food is more scarce to come by in hostile territory. However today was different, celebrating the triumphs of the company, all those in service had gathered in Portnamm for a grand feast hosted by Mr Loopscrew. And this feast was grand, Ollik could see the finest Lorentish wine, Golden Red apples from Little Brook, Southroy Honey Glazed Pork, and the finest Exwesser Cod. At the end of the table, Mr Loopscrew stood atop a stage, with a glass of wine in one hand and a speakerphone in another, and bellowed into the air “A Feast every year! For the whole Army!” The news stunned Ollik but also the nation, the promised feast invigorated every man and Gnome to sign up to Tadlouds, while the farmers doubled their efforts to contribute to the feasts."

 A80_integrate_the_halflings_title:0 "Integrate the Halflings"
 A80_integrate_the_halflings_desc:0 "The halfling people have become an integral part of the Kingdom of Iochand, they tend the fields that keep our people fled, they offer us mead and honey bacon that taste oh so delicious on a summer's day next to the Portroy. It's time the kingdom fully recognizes the service they have provided and instructs the Nimsomms theatre to allow for a full halfling production to be played, allowing audiences to be fully immersed within the halfling culture."

 A80_crushing_the_reavers_title:0 "Crushing the Reavers"
 A80_crushing_the_reavers_desc:0 "In order to restore the kingdom and celebrate as our people always have, we must remove the legacy of the Reavers such that there threat may never disrupt our peoples vibrant art again."

 A80_exploit_baycodds_title:0 "Exploit Baycodds"
 A80_exploit_baycodds_desc:0 "As the influence of the Artficery guild grows within the kingdom and more and more inventions are implemented within daily Iochander life, the need for a steady supply of Damstear as a key regent for experiments grows. While the merchants guilds have siphoned off some of the shipments of damstear from our brothers in Nimscodd, 70% of all production is still dedicated to the academy of Nimscodd. It's time to instruct the merchants to make significant investments in the mines of Baycodds to enable a buyout of the area from our friends."

 A80_nimscodd_academy_programme_title:0 "The N.A.P."
 A80_nimscodd_academy_programme_desc:0 "Traditionally, after the collapse of the hierarchy, the academy of Nimscodd has been historically closed to outsiders, with the rightful paranoia that any new inventions could fall into Kobold hands should information about them leak outside of the academy programme. However, after many trips of the “Shakesgnome” and helping Nimscodd knee cap the threat of the kobolds. A trip has finally been arranged between the Artificer institutions of Portnamm and the academy of Nimscodd, it is thought that the secrets of the academy will aid in arming the Tadlouds with new war equipment."

 A80_revitalise_the_fields_title:0 "Revitalise the Fields"
 A80_revitalise_the_fields_desc:0 "Currently, the dragon coast is littered with small coastal towns dotted up and down the coast. While these have served communities well, as immigration to the kingdom of Iochand increases, we must make use of the inland space we have to accommodate these new numbers. It's time to build new towns within the in-land, building Aqueducts off the major rivers that flow through the dragoncoast to create new vibrant farming communities."

 A80_damestear_powered_loom_title:0 "Damestear Powered Loom"
 A80_damestear_powered_loom_desc:0 "As the Silk trade grows more and more profitable, due to the recent rising popularity of Aerial silks performances within the Nimsomms theatre. The artificers have come up with an ingenious solution to meet demand, rather than needing a new source of expensive silks, there new invention, the Wool Mcguffin, uses the science of artificery to transmute simple wool into silks during the weaving process, allowing for the use of much cheaper input goods for the creation of new silks to support the performing arts economy!"

 A80_raise_mercenary_pay_title:0 "Raise Mercenary Pay"
 A80_raise_mercenary_pay_desc:0 "With the increasing popularity of professional standing armies around the Cannorian content and growth artficery across the continent, it's vital that we retain our highly skilled war artficers within the academy programme and Tadloud Mercneary company. It's therefore necessary to undertake a full pay review of mercenaries to ensure there continued service to the Kingdom. However, this pay increase will likely have a second-order impact of an exodus of manpower leaving the farming communities and joining the mercenary companies looking for a better life."

 A80_destroy_the_competition_title:0 "Iochand Hegemony"
 A80_destroy_the_competition_desc:0 "Iochand has truly become a cultural empire, our theatrical productions spread across continents, while members of high society are frequent guests at the Nimsomms theatre. The merchant guilds thrive and have generated obscene wealth, owning grand manors across the countryside of Lancenor. Meanwhile the city of Portnamm glistens at the mouth of the Portroy, and within it the University of Portnamm stands as a centre of the Gnomish Gommo. Containing some of the greatest scientific minds of Halaan. We have truly beaten our competition."

 A80_restoring_our_heartlands_title:0 "Restoring our Heartlands"
 A80_restoring_our_heartlands_desc:0 "Surrounding the city of Portnamm, within the heartlands of the kingdom, the countryside was dotted by grand gnomish estates belonging to the old gnomish nobility of the past. However, after 200 years of reaver rule they lay abandoned and dilapidated, a mere husk of their former glory. It's time to rebuild these grand homes and convert them into new theatre colleges, offering all those a chance to express and learn about the power of the arts."

 A80_resurgence_of_the_past_title:0 "Resurgence of the Past"
 A80_resurgence_of_the_past_desc:0 "Following the war of the sorcerer king, king Carwick síl Iochand oversaw the beginning of the reconstruction of Portnamm, focusing on restoring the Nimsnoms Theatre and University of Portnamm. This peace and rebuilding would see the nation of Iochand reach a new peak in cultural and economic power. It’s time to follow in our ancestors and bring about a new age of prosperity by building up the city of Portnamm!"

 A80_rebuilding_nimsomms_title:0 "Refurbishing the Nimsnoms "
 A80_rebuilding_nimsomms_desc:0 "The Nimsnoms theatre is critical to our culture, it's where our Kingdom began with the crowning of the first king of Iochand, Fizwick I in the theatre using a prop crown (although the theatre props were known for such authenticity that the crown was of excellent make). It's also key for the integration of Human and Gnomish societies to one blended culture, through the power of the arts, both races have come to understand each other and many of their shared traits can be traced back to the theatre productions of the past. However, since the tragedy the theatre has been left critically underfunded, with broken chairs and ripped costumes. It’s time to re-invest back in theatre and restore our wonder of the world!"

 A80_artificer_academy_title:0 "University of Portnamm"
 A80_artificer_academy_desc:0 "Historically a collection of small institutions focused on developing artificery, alchemy, and other magic-adjacent studies. Under the watchful eye of the Oddansbay Gommo the disunified buildings began to expand and encompass an entire district of the City of Portnamm, and was eventually declared the University of Portnamm. While the university has largely remained focused on civilian artificery and hosting the Nimsnoms School of Dramatic Arts, the recent performance of the Tadlouds Mercenary on the battlefield have caught the eyes of many officials within the kingdom including Mr Loopwrench. Mr Loopwrench has worked up a new scheme, he proposes that the crown build a new wing of the university, to host a new programme dubbed simply the “Academy Programme”, focused on developing battle artificery. In turn he will offer the graduates of the programme lucrative mercenary contracts to form a new academy mercenary company to serve the state and even upgrade the equipment of the current crop of Tadloud Mercenaries."

 A80_jewel_on_the_westcoast_title:0 "Jewel on the Westcoast"
 A80_jewel_on_the_westcoast_desc:0 "Portnamm has truly grown from humble begginings, from its begginings as a trading outpost for the old hierarchy in 1044 BA, to the development of the great insutitions of the Nimsomms and the University under our first king Fizwick AllSpark in 471 AA and now to the greatest surface city on earth!"

 A80_shady_deals_title:0 "Shady Deals"
 A80_shady_deals_desc:0 "The Merchant guild and Mr Loopwrench have a notorious reputation for writing contracts that have often been called 'Wex Cheese', often preying on those who are new to the merchant guild and the world of trading. Usually, the guild can get away with this, however recent attempts to implement this practice within the city of Beepeck have fallen flat on there face, with Mr Loopwrench underestimating the financial nous of the halflings. Furious, he has demanded that we actively intervene and take a slice of the small country, to show that they should take him and the merchant guild more seriously." 

 A80_debts_collected_title:0 "Establish A Foothold"
 A80_debts_collected_desc:0 "With our initial beachhead into the small country, we must establish a set of frontline merchant posts for the guild to conduct their business within the small country, as we cannot currently guarantee their safety amongst the halfling population who view us as foreign invaders of a foreign culture. These trading posts will act as our commercial links into the empire and break the dominance of the halfling nation."

 A80_inland_trade_title:0 "Inland Trade"
 A80_inland_trade_desc:0 "By consolidating small trading enterprises of the small country into large enterprises, the Unviersity of Portnamm has been able to retain Damestear trade within the dragoncoast and end illegal damstear smuggling. This has enabled us to hold onto more Damestear, and effectivley double the amount of artficery that can be done from every 1G of Damstear mined."

 A80_undo_the_past_title:0 "Undo the past"
 A80_undo_the_past_desc:0 "The Portroy Agreement has always been hotly contested within the halls of power within the city of Portnam and the kingdom of Iochand, on one hand it is what saved the city from guaranteed annihilation during the tragedy. However, on the other hand it has separated us from our gnomish kin within Southroy and was not even signed by the nation of Iochand itself! Now we are born anew, it’s time to load the “Shakesgnome” and send a delegation to the lorentish king to look closer at the terms of this “agreement” and rearrange terms in our favour."

 A80_secure_costume_supply_title:0 "Secure Costumes"
 A80_secure_costume_supply_desc:0 "With the refurbishment of the Nimsomms, the establishment is now beautiful, with captivating paintings of world famous plays such as 'Gnomeo & Juliett' littered through the halls of the theatre, and multiple 1000+ seat capacity halls hosting play,musicians and all kind of performers nightly, It is truly now of a scale that is not just a theatre for the high society, but can also be enjoyed by the common folk of Iochand and across Cannnor. However, while recent reviews of the plays by The Bitter Berry Guild have been above 90%, they all complain about one thing, the dullness of the costumes. It’s time to commission the development of a new silk industry within Cannor and ensure an 100% rating for all productions!"

 A80_portnamm_academy_programme_title:0 "The Portnamm Gommo"
 A80_portnamm_academy_programme_desc:0 "The artficer instutions of the city of Portnamm have always been overseen by the Oddansbay Gommo, however With the growth of the city of Portnamm and our domination over the Gommo of Nimscodd, it's time to turn the tables on the Oddansbay Gommo and declare the new Portnamm Gommo! That will dominate the world of Artficery within the heart of Gnomish heartlands."

 A80_twin_academy_programme_title:0 "The T.A.P."
 A80_twin_academy_programme_desc:0 "By combining the direction of the Portnamm Gommo and the archives of the ancient Nimscodd academy, our artificer industry has flourished. Inventing new holographic shows for the Nimsomms theatre and most importantly arming the various companies the Kingdom of Iochand employ for defence. Throughout the years, the Gommo has truly pioneered a number of inventions that makes our world famous mercenaries the object of the world's desire. "

 A80_dominate_silk_trade_title:0 "Dominate Silk Trade"
 A80_dominate_silk_trade_desc:0 "The growth of the Silk industry has been truly remarkable, what was once a rare good coming from the sun kissed land of Bulwar is now worn by the every man and Gnome within our Kingdom and is a coveted commodity for the nobility and high society across the continent, we have truly become the masters of silk."

 A80_advanced_silk_production_title:0 "Red Cap Production"
 A80_advanced_silk_production_desc:0 "The most common garment sold to visitors to the city of Portnamm are red caps, a common sight amongst the gnomes living in the dragon coast. However, these red-caps were originally designed for gnomish heads and the popularity of the Nimscomms has meant visitors from the many races of Cannor flock to the city, from the dwarves off the rubyhold, to the elves of moonhaven! This has meant that red-caps have had to be produced in many different sizes, leading to inefficiencies due to the extra calibration of the looms required. However, the artificers have come up w/ a new solution, through the use of an damstear infused machine called “The Stretchweave Engine”, clothing items will now shrink / enlarge to a person's body shape. This has allowed the effective fulfilment of orders without lengthy recalibration and has allowed us to serve orders to all the people of Halaan! "

 A80_borders_restored_title:0 "Borders Restored"
 A80_borders_restored_desc:0 "Today marks a special day where the historical borders of the kingdom of Iochand have finally been restored, celebrations flood the streets while the Nimsomns theatre is booked out for the week with audacious celebrations, concerts and parties for the people of our kingdom. However, now is not the time to rest, with the capitulation of Lorent a power vacuum has been left within Lacenor, a vacuum the merchants guild looks to fill..."

 A80_push_into_westport_title:0 "Push into Westport"
 A80_push_into_westport_desc:0 "While we have done our best, the dragon coast is admittedly a poor region to conduct business in. The rugged landscape outside of the core provinces of Iochand and the southern dragoncoast owes little to development, furthermore our only other option for trade to the north is the Reavers, which is out of the question considering our blackened history. Therefore, we must look south and establish new trade routes beyond Sildthol and exploit the riches of Lacenor."

 A80_establish_new_trade_title:0 "Art Economics"
 A80_establish_new_trade_desc:0 "With our recent 'acquisition' of Lancenor on behalf of Mr Loopwrench and the Merchants guilds, it's now time to establish our position as a new player within the region and create new hubs for the performing arts. Using these we will naturally drive traders to visit our lands and deprive others of their loose change."

 A80_trade_monopoly_title:0 "Trade Monopoly"
 A80_trade_monopoly_desc:0 "With our cultural influence in Lacenor well and truly cemented and our economic links dominant, it is time to complete the acquisition of Lacenor and truly establish ourselves as a global trading powerhouse"

 A80_westport_costumes_title:0 "Westport Costumes"
 A80_westport_costumes_desc:0 "With the conquest of Westport complete, it's time to host the grandest of all the plays within Adeanscour, a tale about the chilvarous Academy & Tadloud Mercenaries should fit the venue. However, before the play we must first gather the costumes for this grand production. Additionally, we will need to ensure the surrounding provinces have the necessary infrastructure to support the hundered of thousands of cannorians that will flock to the see this final grand production."

 A80_westport_united_title:0 "The Great Play Of Westport"
 A80_westport_united_desc:0 "The curtains open, as the sunset beams off freshly polished wood, a 1000 members of the Tadlouds and the Academy Programme stand there in pristine uniforms, with colours as vibrant as an orchard. Suddenly the scene changes to depict the Ancient forests of the Redglades, with flurries of smoke and cannon fire as the Tadlouds perform their marching orders on stage. After this, the curtains close again and are replaced by famous gnomish aerial silk performers, performing a complex set of climbs, wraps and drops in synchronous order. All to a grand orchestra playing the anthem of Portnamm and famous classical plays of Cannor. For the final act, the audience follow the triumphant tale of the Tadlouds mercenary Olik as he joins the company during the reconquest of Reveria and eventually ends on Olik front and centre flanked by members of the Tadloud & Academy mercenary companies as the curtains close..."
